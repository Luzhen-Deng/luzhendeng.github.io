Nice to meet you!

I’m Luzhen Deng, a passionate researcher specializing in computational imaging. Currently, I work as an Algorithm Engineer at Shanghai Neusoft Medical Co., Ltd., where I focus on developing non-Cartesian reconstruction algorithms for MRI systems and building a CUDA-based platform for the reconstruction team.

Before joining Neusoft Medical, I was an Algorithm Engineer at Shanghai UEG Medical Imaging Equipment Co., Ltd. (2019–2021), working on CT reconstruction algorithms.

I earned my Ph.D. in Optical Engineering from Chongqing University in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Biao Wei. During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I had the privilege of collaborating with Prof. Sang Hyun Cho. My graduate research primarily focused on X-ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography (XFCT).
